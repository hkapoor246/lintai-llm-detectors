# LintAI Frontend

This is the frontend web interface for the LintAI project. It is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Redux Toolkit. The UI provides visualizations (including Cytoscape graphs), configuration panels, and dashboards to interact with AI scan results and system components.

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- **React** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast builds
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **React Router** for routing
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **Cytoscape.js** for graph visualizations
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for local API mocking
- **Vitest** for unit testing

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+
- Yarn (`npm install -g yarn`)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd lintai/ui/frontend
yarn install
````

### Build for Production

## ðŸ§ª Mock API (MSW)

MSW (Mock Service Worker) is used to simulate API responses during development and testing. It is automatically enabled in development environments.
